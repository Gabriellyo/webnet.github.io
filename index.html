<h1>Univers</h1>
<h2>The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[12][13] Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe. </h2><br />

<h1>Infinity</h1> <br/>

<br /><h2>Every day we make thousands of little choices that can influence the outcome of your day, and each one of those choice has an infinite array of opposite possibilities. ‘A Truncated Story of Infinity’ is Paul Trillo‘s attempt to bedazzle us with the science behind infinite possibility in our every day lives.</h2><br />

<br /><h2><li>What Does NASA Do?</li>
NASA does a lot of different things. NASA makes satellites. The satellites help scientists learn more about Earth. NASA sends probes into space. NASA scientists study things in the solar system and even farther away. A new program will send humans to explore the Moon and, one day, Mars. NASA also shares what they learn with others. People who do not work at NASA can use NASA ideas to make new inventions. These new inventions can help make life on Earth better. </h2>
